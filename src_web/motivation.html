<h1>Motivating Data Storm</h1>
The primary reason for creating Data Storm is to make test driven development (TDD) easier, when test involve databases. An often used
technique is after executing a test case, to roll-back the data base. Frameworks such as <a href="http://www.springsource.org">Spring</a> 
natively support this strategy. The roll-back happens irregardless of an error or succesful execution of the test case.
<p>
<b>The biggest draw back of this testing approach is that should a test case fail it can be very difficult to resolve the problem as you 
cannot see the data involved with the executing code</b>. Such a situation is depicted below.
<p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
</p>
Did the test fail because no rows were inserted, or is the <tt>load()</tt> flawed? Or maybe its the constraints on the <tt>load()</tt> 
that prevents it from finding the order (maybe only non-closed orders are found, or orders after year 2000,...). 
Resolving such simple problems can be very tedious indeed due to the lack of access to the underlying data.

<ul>
<li>Since the transaction is automatically rolled back at the end of the test an ordinary browser cannot inspect the data.</li>
<li>Since during the execution of a test, all database inserts, deletes and updates happens in an isolated transaction, 
 an ordinary database browser cannot inspect the data available to the test method.</li>
<li>Temporarily turning off the automatic roll-back after testing, can easily invalidate your existing reference data in the data base, which must be
restored at some point.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Solution</h2>
Data Storm was invented to put the fun back into xUnit testing (at least for tests involving a database :-). It is simply a database viewer,
 that uses the same transaction as your tests, hence it has access to display or even modify your data! Launching requires the following code
 <p>
 <pre>
 new DataStorm().show(connection);
 </pre>
 </p>
 
Which when executed presents you with a window similar to 
 
<p>
<blockquote>
<img src="img/datastorm_window.png" alt="data storm window">
</blockquote>
</p>

Data Storm clearly shows us that data was in fact inserted, so attention must be targeted the <tt>load()</tt>... When Data Storm window is 
opened, one can fire any number of queries at the data base. See also <a href="using_datastorm.html">using data storm</a> for more information.

Have fun!
