<h1>Using Data Storm</h1>

In order to use Data Storm, you need to add <tt>datastorm.jar</tt> and <tt>SWT.jar</tt> to your class path.
<p>
When you then have a test case that is failing, then all you need to do is insert the following code to open a data storm window to inspect
your database.

<pre class="prettyprint">
class FooTest {
    public void testSomething() {
        <b>new DataStorm().show(conn);</b>
    }
}
</pre>

Where <tt>conn</tt> is either a <tt>import java.sql.Connection</tt> or a <tt>DataSource</tt>. This will open an empty window. 
<p>
You probably become tired of firing the same SQL each time, and you may forget from test to test what SQL is nice to use. Hence, you can
pre-populate the Data Storm window with SQL which is automatically executed upon opening the window. To do so, you use the overloaded method



<pre class="prettyprint">
new DataStorm().show(conn, "SELECT * FROM foo, bar WHERE foo.id = bar.foo_id");
</pre>
