Datastorm
=========

Imported this project from Sourceforge http://datastorm.sourceforge.net/

When testing using a database with rollback after each test, failing tests are very hard to resolve. 
Data Storm is a simple DB viewer directly launchable from within your test code to enable you to inspect the current state of the database.

The project was built on SWT so that raises some minor issues on Mac OS X.
